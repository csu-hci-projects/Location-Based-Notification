       <h1>Location-Based-Notification</h1>

        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>Most Americans own smartphones nowadays, about 97% says the Pew research center, this is a big change over the last decade compared to 35% when the Pew first started back in 2011. With this rise in smartphones is also a rise in many users experiencing stress from receiving notifications all the time. In this paper we will be looking into the users of smartphones and their relationship between notifications and stress. Specifically this paper's goal is to better understand that relationship within the variable of location. In order to understand that, I collected a small set of data about where people most often are, in their day, between home and some type of work or school activity. I used snapchat and my own app created with android studio, to record surveys of my users. This allowed us to better understand some users' preferences on when they should receive notifications in terms of location. This small survey study can show users preferences for receiving notifications at certain locations.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Since the beginning of technology, especially heading into the industrial era we have used alarms to alert us of certain situations within our tech environments. As we continue evolving with the technology around us we still use alarms to interact with it. Through notifications, we interact with many of the applications that we use daily, from phone notifications to daily reminders. This allows companies to alert us when we need to pay attention or if anything in the app got updated that we might want to check. Because this tool is so useful to companies to increase interaction it brings the question of how to most effectively send notifications so that the notification has high engagement. 
          What I mean in high engagement is users opening the app and interacting with it. Doing this while trying to make sure to not annoy the user. Allows for higher engagement in the app.[6] 
          The interaction of notifications works on several contextual factors such as the smartphone position, the user’s location, and their activity [1]. In this paper I will be looking into the factor of user’s location and investigate the preferences of my participants for different notification modals.
          The content types of using smartphone notifications include messenger messages, SMSs, phone calls, mail services, social network services, games, advertisements, system states, update alerts, etc. Smartphones offer various methods for receiving notifications, including a status bar, LED indicator, screen pop-up, vibration, sound, or a combination of these in order to let a user know that he or she has received a notification 
          Found in other literature pushes a correlation between a user’s location and the activity performed at that location aka “location-based activity”.[2] Location information will be collected in 2 formats, GPS and Location-based activity. GPS location can be correlated with Google maps, to find the building they are located in. The location-based activity will be collected via survey when the user opens the notification. In this paper we will investigate the user’s locations effects on participants notification’s receptivity and interruptibility [4&5]

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>I’ve decided to run this in a more natural setting, using peoples phones, and a survey. I had 10 users participate in this study, it is a within-subject as we have users test both sides of receiving notifications. The goal is to observe my participants and how they interact with notifications if they know when they receive the notification based on location. My study will mostly have my participants be within-subjects, as each participant marks their ‘Home’ and ‘Work/School’ location and we send randomly timed notifications when the user is located within these areas. I will send these notifications out at around 15 minutes after entering the marked locations. Upon receiving the notification, a timer will start to see how long it takes for the participant to open the notification, along with how long it takes to fill out the survey. Which will consist of questions similar to other studies[3]:
          How Unpleasant was the reception of this notification(1-not,7-Very Unpleasant)
          How interruptive was this notification in general(1-not,7-Very interruptive)
          What activities did this notification interrupt feel free to list a few(short answer)
          How interruptive was this notification to that particular activity(1-not,7-Very interruptive)
          </p>
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>Let's get this out there first. This survey is based on ten people so the results should be verified with a bigger pool to be accurate. But based on my survey, receiving messages at home or at work is similarly annoying. Home Being 4.9 and Work being 5.4 on a scale from 1 to 7. This is very close and I think shows that the app and work you're doing on the app affects the annoyance more than the location. But for Interruptive there is a clear lower average for home than for work, this is more abundant when you look at the differences in tasks and Task Interruptibility. Most people's Work tasks were more involved than home this led to a very high activity interrupted number. This number represents how much the notifications interrupting that activity and that was 3.9 - Home vs 6 - Work/School. It is clear for this one day that most people working didn't not like to be interrupted to fill out a survey. It was useful in asking how interruptive the notification was in general vs the activity. 
        </p>
        <h1>Discussion</h1>
        <p>In general this data set is too small to really be conclusive about my results. But if I were to take my data at its word its aligns with many of the other papers I’ve read where location is important but only because of the type of activities you should expect to do there, When doing this experiment it seemed that home was better place to receive notifications because it was less interruptive to the activities at hand. While on the opposite spectrum work/school was more interruptive to the task at hand. When reading the activity vs the interriptivness it was clear that if people were doing easier activities at work then they would be more receptive to notifications or harder tasks at home less receptive.So It really had less to do with the location but more to do with the activity. It just so happens that the activities you do at home are usually less intense then the ones you do at work.e</p>
